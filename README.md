## Test

### Local
- Server
```
./run_server.sh
```
This will automatically show files that server received after the program terminates and calculate success rate and the number of correct files.

- Client
```
./run_client.sh
```
This will automatically generate files if the target directory is empty before we run the client.

\# Note: You should run `./run_server.sh` and `./run_client.sh` on two windows simultaneously

### Play with challenge server
```
./submit.sh
```
